        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>115g frozen peas</li>
            <li>250g cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>800g boiled and cooled long-grain-rice</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of the oil in a large wok. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly on a medium heat for 5 minutes until the onion starts to turn soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add in the remaining vegetable oil, chopped red bell pepper, garlic, and peas. Cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Now add chicken and sesame oil. Stir together, then add in the rice and turn up the heat to high.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to toss everything together and to ensure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Keep moving the rice around so that it's all getting reheated.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is hot (this will take about 5 minutes), push the rice over to the side of the pan and crack the two eggs in the space. Add a little splash of the soy sauce to the eggs.</li>
            <li>Making sure the part of the wok with the eggs in is over the heat, fry the eggs, giving a mix with the spatula until the egg starts to cook and looks scrambled, but is still a little runny.</li>
            <li>Now mix the egg into the rice.</li>
            <li>Pour in the remaining soy sauce, sprinkle on the salt and mix it all together.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice, stir and taste. Add a little more lemon juice if required.</li>
            <li>Divide between 4 bowls. Top with spring onions (scallions).</li>
        </ol>
